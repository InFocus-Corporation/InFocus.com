Also remember, if you are using USB to connect, Not all projectors can project over USB. Check your user manual to confirm whether your projector supports this feature. Finally make sure you have the correct source selected on the projector (again, refer to the user manual for instructions on changing the source). It can take as much as 10-15 seconds for auto source to sync with the connection you are using.
